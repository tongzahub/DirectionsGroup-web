Why Blue–White Works Well in 2025

Fits the “Minimal but Dynamic” trend — clean layouts, soft colors, and lots of whitespace.

Blue tones create feelings of trust, safety, calmness, and modernity.

Works great with micro-interactions and light gradients for a futuristic look.

Easy on the eyes — perfect for mobile-first and long-use applications.

✨ UI Style Guidelines (2025)

Use whitespace generously for a clean layout.

Use rounded corners (12–20px) and soft shadows for cards.

Prefer blue buttons on white backgrounds for strong contrast.

Use light gradients (blue → lighter blue) for headers or hero sections.

Keep animations subtle: fade, slide, micro-interaction hover effects.
